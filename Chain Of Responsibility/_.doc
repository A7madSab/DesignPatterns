 Chain of Responsibility relies on transforming particular behaviors into stand-alone objects
  called handlers. In our case, each check should be extracted to its own class with a single
  method that performs the check. The request, along with its data, is passed to this method
  as an argument.


  Chain of Responsibility passes a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.
