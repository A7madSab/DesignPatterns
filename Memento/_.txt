Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state 
 of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so
 that the object can be returned to this state later.

Promote undo or rollback to full object status.

1- Originator - the object that knows how to save itself.

2- Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and
 restore itself.

3- Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded
 by the Caretaker.
